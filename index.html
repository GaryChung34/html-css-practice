			<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
			<p class="mainPassage">JavaScript is the programming language of the web. The overwhelming majority of
websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, tablets, and
phones—include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most-deployed programming
language in history. Over the last decade, Node.js has enabled JavaScript
programming outside of web browsers, and the dramatic success of Node means that
JavaScript is now also the most-used programming language among software developers.
Whether you’re starting from scratch or are already using JavaScript professionally,
this book will help you master the language.</p>
			<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
			<p class="mainPassage">If you are already familiar with other programming languages, it may help you to
know that JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that
is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles. JavaScript’s variables
are untyped. Its syntax is loosely based on Java, but the languages are otherwise
unrelated. JavaScript derives its first-class functions from Scheme and its prototypebased
inheritance from the little-known language Self. But you do not need to know
any of those languages, or be familiar with those terms, to use this book and learn
JavaScript.</p>
			<h2 id="ch3">Chapter 3</h2>
			<p class="mainPassage">The name “JavaScript” is quite misleading. Except for a superficial syntactic resemblance,
JavaScript is completely different from the Java programming language. And
JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a robust
and efficient general-purpose language suitable for serious software engineering and
projects with huge codebases.</p>
			<h2 id="ch4">Chapter 4</h2>
			<p class="mainPassage">JavaScript was created at Netscape in the early days of the web, and technically, “Java‐
Script” is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) used to describe
Netscape’s (now Mozilla’s) implementation of the language. Netscape submitted the
language for standardization to ECMA—the European Computer Manufacturer’s
Association—and because of trademark issues, the standardized version of the language
was stuck with the awkward name “ECMAScript.” In practice, everyone just
calls the language JavaScript. This book uses the name “ECMAScript” and the abbreviation
“ES” to refer to the language standard and to versions of that standard./p>
			<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
			<p class="mainPassage">For most of the 2010s, version 5 of the ECMAScript standard has been supported by
all web browsers. This book treats ES5 as the compatibility baseline and no longer
discusses earlier versions of the language. ES6 was released in 2015 and added major
new features—including class and module syntax—that changed JavaScript from a
scripting language into a serious, general-purpose language suitable for large-scale
software engineering. Since ES6, the ECMAScript specification has moved to a yearly
release cadence, and versions of the language—ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019, and
ES2020—are now identified by year of release.</p>
			<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
			<p class="mainPassage">To be useful, every language must have a platform, or standard library, for performing
things like basic input and output. The core JavaScript language defines a minimal
API for working with numbers, text, arrays, sets, maps, and so on, but does not
include any input or output functionality. Input and output (as well as more sophisticated
features, such as networking, storage, and graphics) are the responsibility of the
“host environment” within which JavaScript is embedded.</p>
